I start the project late because of some stuff to fix from my side 

I was stuck because after copy the boiler i always get a blank page on the local 

Facu help me to fix the issue, my computer was done and Chloe proposed me to work from his computer.

After that when i was trying to push my commit i get an error that I wasn't authorized ( as i was working from Chloe's computer then i was getting this error)

After looking hoz to fix this error i found that i was able to give the access to the project to Chloe so I send an invitatio, she accept it and then I was finally able to push my work on git hub.

The only thing we didn't fix was the fact the commit was send by Chloe because I was working on his computer.
